1. My solution for upating the balance factors does not preserve the O(log n) behavior for the addElement and removeElement methods becuase I use a recursive method to calculate the new balance factor. With the O(log n) behavior of addElement and the O(n) behavior of the recursive method, makes this O(nlogn). 

2. If you had given a height attribute of its sub-tree in each node, rather than a balance factor, it would still be possible to implement an AVL rebalancing strategy on the design. I would just have had to create a new method that calculated the balancing factor, which would have just been another step. The difference between the original method, is that I would have to create an equation for height of right subtree minus height of left subtree to determine if I needed to rebalance the tree.
