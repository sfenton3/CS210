Project 1 Questions

1. It is a good idea to choose names like plus and minus for method names,so someone that
is using the class does not need to know what is in the methods to use them.

2. You can pass an array of Polynomial objects to the Arrays.sort method which requires an array
of Comparable objects because we implemented the comparable interface. The interface overrode our
compareTo method, allowing it to take in Polynomial objects.

3. I used the Dr Java debugger to find errors in the polynomial class when I was
getting null pointer exception errors. I thought that the debugger was useful when
you identified an error you were encountering, but was not a magic answer to my problem.


4. It was helpful to have the TestPolynomial class while writing the code
in my Polynomial class because it allowed rigorous testing of our methods
and we did not have to manually input every case over and over again.

5. The javadoc web pages did not help me write the application class at the end.
I mostly used the javadoc as a good visual for what each method was doing, and how they interacted.
